  ChangeLog: "Produced PPT and Youtube walk through of product.  Did notice a few
    minor bugs, and I will correct them in a follow up version.  Particularly, The
    history list doesn't clean itself up after deletes, and it doesn't complain about
    it either.  \nThis broke after adding following feature:\n\nAlso added <, >, ==,
    != for version comparison, and also added version and a function for comparisons
    against number based version IsGreaterThan, IsLessThan & IsEqualTo"
