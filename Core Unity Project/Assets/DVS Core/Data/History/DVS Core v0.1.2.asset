  ChangeLog: 'Versions can no longer be created on their own.  Instead, you must use
    the versioning system.

    Bug found, Deleting the end, or second to last item from the history would lose
    the current version.  That was fixed.

    Clicking next actually traverses the connections.  no matter what order things
    were deleted.
